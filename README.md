 A discord console message logger

I just took it and made it work for me

How to use:
* Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/.
* Open your console and type in `npm install discord.js-selfbot`.
* Get your discord token (search up how if you don't know) and put it in the `settings.json` file.
* Open `run.bat` then wait (don't click the console window otherwise it'll freeze, tapping the bar to move the window is fine).

Now all messages (deleted and edited) will be logged into the console

Do whatever you want with the code I don't think anyone cares
